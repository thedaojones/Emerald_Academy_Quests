Emerald Academy DAO Workshop Quests

Chapter 1 Day 1
1) Explain what the blockchain is in your own words.

  The blockchain is a distributed database of digital information that is open to be viewed by anyone.

2) Explain what a smart contract is.

  A smart contract is a program that a developer makes that executes when predetermined conditions are met. These rules cannot be adjusted at a later point unless the original contract was originally formatted for this to be possible.

3) Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

  A script is free and can view information on a blockchain, while a transaction has a cost, or gas fee, and changes data/information on the blockchain.



Chapter 1 Day 2
  1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- Safety and security - 
There is separation between transactions and contracts to make sure that issues do not arise, alongside a strong system type and Resource Oriented Programming.

- Clarity -
Cadence code is human-readable and declaritive, making it easier to read for users that are trying to read information like smart contracts in an efficient and reliable manner.

- Approachability -
Cadance presents similarly to other coding languages, so experienced coders will likely feel that they are faimiliar with it to some extent.

- Developer Experience -
Cadance makes error messages very clear, which is helpful for developers who are debugging code.

- Resource Oriented Programming -
Cadence's core is made up of resources that make up pretty much everything we do on Flow.

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

  Safety, Security, and Clarity will help people feel comfortable interacting with the block chain as well as writing smart contracts for it. Approachability will get more people to be ineterested in attempting to code, and developer experience will lead to them staying with your language for a longer period of time on average. Resource Oriented Programming is part of the equation for how to track ownership of information on the blockchain, so is of course a key part of Cadence.
